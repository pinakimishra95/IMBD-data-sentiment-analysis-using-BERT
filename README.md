IMBD data sentiment analysis using BERT


The above project in develop on the top of BERT (The most powerfull NLP model) with the help of Ktrain libariay .
All the required infos are present inside the project like dataset and all.

hey , lets start some BERT thing …
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a recent paper published by researchers at Google AI Language. It has caused a stir in the Machine Learning community by presenting state-of-the-art results in a wide variety of NLP tasks, including Question Answering (SQuAD v1.1), Natural Language Inference (MNLI), and others.
BERT is a pre-trained unsupervised natural language processing model. BERT can outperform 11 of the most common NLP tasks after fine-tuning, essentially becoming a rocket booster for Natural Language Processing and Understanding.
This breakthrough was the result of Google research on transformers: models that process words in relation to all the other words in a sentence, rather than one-by-one in order. BERT models can therefore consider the full context of a word by looking at the words that come before and after it — particularly useful for understanding the intent behind search queries.
